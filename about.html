         <p>
            Our company was founded in 2022 by Kali Connor. She was 
            always passionate about climate change and its effects on
            the Ocean, but in 2020 when she took an Oceanogrpahy class,
            a spark ignited in her heart. She knew she needed to do something,
            so she started researching about companies who clean the ocean 
            and how they find the funds to do so. 
            

         </p>
         <p> 
            And so, Ocean Motion was born!
            
            <p>
               We create and manufacture
            bracelets made out of 100% recylced material from the Ocean. 
            By selling these environmentally friendly accessories, we raise 
            enough money to get out on the beautiful ocean and sift trash that
            collects there. We collect all trash and pollutants, whether 
            it is on the surface of the water or wrapped around the coral reefs below. 
            No trash is too big for us!
